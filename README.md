# mac_changer
# This is a simple program to change your Linux device's MAC address.
# While you can easily change your MAC address from the terminal,
# this program incorporates error-checking to ensure the user is
# entering the correct format, returning the current MAC address before
# comitting the change to the specified interface, and provide verbosity
# where applicable.
#
# This program will soon incorporate a simple GUI to provide new Linux users
# a simple and straightforward experience with early penetration testing techniques.
#
# *** Please utilize the `help` menu with either -h or --help if you need information on
# which flags to use in which order.
